For my undergraduate dissertation project. This application uses WxPython and PyCryptodome to allow the user to upload a file of any extension, and encrypt the files contents using The Advanced Encryption Standard, specifically AES-256. Requiring a password first before encryption, the files can also be decrypted using the same password. The reason I chose to develop this application was to give users a simple, yet effective, way of protecting their personal files.
